 --------->Procedure oriented Programming 
*** main focus is on  functions and not on flow of data
*** function can either use local or global data
*** data moves openly from functions to   (these are the bsic that are used by used )

  ---------->c++ Object Oriented Programming
*** class is user defined datatype

*** works on the concept of classes and objects. --> class are like templete with the help of class we create objects 
 classes doesnot take space in memory but in object it take space.
*** data is treated as critical elements (restriced can be done).
*** decomposes the problem in objects and builds data and functions around the objects.



Basic concept in object oriented programming

 classes --->basic tamplet for creating objects
 objects --->basic run time entities
 data Abstraction ans Encapsulation --->wrapping data and function into single unit
 inheritance ---> propertied of one class can be inherited into others
 polymorphism ---> ability to make more than one form
 dynamic(data) Binding ---> code which will execute is not known until the program runs
 message passing ---> object.message(information) call format 


 benefits of oops
 --> code reuseability
 --> principle of data hiding 
 --> multiple objects can co-exits without any interference
 --> software complexcity can be easily managed
